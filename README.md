This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario in Python involving list comprehensions and exception handling. The code attempts to extract values from a list of dictionaries. However, it handles both KeyError (missing key) and TypeError (trying to access a key on an object that's not a dictionary) exceptions, making debugging more complex than typical KeyErrors or TypeErrors. The solution file offers a safer approach to extracting data from the list.  This bug is designed to help programmers better understand handling multiple exceptions that might arise in list comprehensions.
